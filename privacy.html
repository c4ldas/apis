              liability for their respective privacy policies.
            </p>
            <p>
              We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to
              provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means,
              with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we're
              collecting it and how it will be used.

            <p>
              We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to
              provide you with your requested service. What data we store, we'll
              protect within commercially acceptable best-practice means to
              prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access,
              disclosure, copying, use or modification. The time period for
              which we keep information varies according to what the information
              is used for. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep
              data for a minimum period. Unless there is a specific legal
              requirement for us to keep the information, we will retain it for
              no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data
              was collected or for which it is to be further processed.
            </p>
            <p>
              We don't share any personally identifying information publicly or
